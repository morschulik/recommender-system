# Recommender Systems

# Objectives:

- [x] Learn about the different types of recommendation systems
- [x] Review and collect courses and information about the topic 
- [x] Explore the *content based* and *collaborative filter* recommenders using the movielens dataset
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of the above recommenders in predicting user preferences using some metrics
- [ ] Compare the CO2 footprint of each of the above recommender system
- [ ] Build a hybrid system of the above systems
-[ ] Build an End to End recommendation system (in the cloud)
- [ ] Build a small App (using Django or fastapi) with the recommendation system

### sourses for outlook further works:
a project that used the tensorflow to build a recommender system is available here

from the above notebook we can find a way to get and download the data in the notebook
